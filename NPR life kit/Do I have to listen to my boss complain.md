[Dear Life Kit: Do I have to listen to my boss complain? : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1160475109)
## vocabulory
Being that trusted **confidant** and providing emotional support is something I believe strengthens connections and improves the quality of work.

I think, as long as you're friendly, **courteous**, you know, kind, not an **expletive** - no, I'm not allowed to say expletive - not a **butt**, then you - then that can make you a really good co-worker.

Or she can figure out how to, like, I think, **corral** the energy that she has invited into one place.

But that line feels really **nebulous**.

And I think, oftentimes, when you cultivate that sort of emotional connection, it can also be harder to make the right decision about speaking up about mistreatment, about **exploitation**, about, you know, even just coming to the point of recs ognition that this job is no longer a good job for me.
## phrase
Today on the show - my boss constantly **unloads** her emotional baggage **on** me. I'm **drained**, and I don't know what to do.

I don't want to harm our working relationship, but I'm **nearing my wits' end**.

I'm often told that I'm a good listener, and I do love to listen. So, like, establishing their **bona fides** in this is part of their personality.

You can ask and **pepper questions** throughout the day or your relationship that are saying - what is working really well?
