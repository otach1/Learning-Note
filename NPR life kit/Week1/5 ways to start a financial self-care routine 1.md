## vocabulory
Arezou Rezvani covers personal finance and housing for NPR, and she says there's this **inertia** that happens with our savings.

It seems like a little bit of a **hassle**, but I think it's worth it in this moment of high inflation.

You know, if you look at how people were spending and saving during the **pandemic**, you know, a lot of people were getting government assistance.

And so they can afford to offer really **skimpy** rates.

And nowadays, because of the recent banking **turmoil**, you will see that some of these smaller banks have actually increased some of their - the interest rates they're offering their customers because they want to keep the money in their institutions.

What about online banks where there's no **brick-and-mortar** location to go into?

Now, 4% isn't a lot of money, but the point is not to, you know, score the big **bucks**.

I will note you have to be very, very careful about entering your account numbers because getting that fixed is a very long, **drawn-out** process that involves snail mail.

So, you know, if you plan to hold onto a bond for 30 years and you want to cash out when you're retired, you're going to belong presumably to a different tax **bracket**, and so it might really work out for you to keep it as a long-term investment and to cash in later in life.
## phrase
Also, over the past few years, a lot of us got used to the **measly** point-something percent interest rates that our savings accounts were offering, because that's just kind of how it was **across the board**.

those are some really good reliable websites you can go to to **get a lay of the land** - **to get a sense of** what's out there.
