## vocabulory
A couple of people are very **opinionated** and rely on our group to manage their anxiety in toxic ways.

The norm in the group is to **reassure** whoever is most upset, even when that person is wrong.

I pushed back and said they made a serious **lapse** and to change their behavior.

Is there a way to **salvage** this?

It decides what its flavor is and what its **vibe** is.

Read the room and identify one or two people you're closest with and then express the **sentiment** to them and see what they think about it.

But I will add, I've never seen a group chat **rehabilitate** itself.
## pharse
Another example: one friend admitted to **bullying another over a movie opinion**. The group then **sided with** the bully because they thought the victim should **keep the peace**.

it doesn't mean that **engaging with all of them** together is a great idea.

We all need those spaces where we can take our masks off a little bit, **chill out** with each other and speak honestly and openly.

You **come off as afraid**, which tells me that maybe your group chat has **worn out its welcome**.
