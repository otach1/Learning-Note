Today on the show, what happens when news **outlets** who have seen big revenue drops in recent years want to get money from Big Tech, but Big Tech says no thanks?

She told me when she wanted to share the latest updates about **evacuation** orders from that site, she had to **manually** screenshot them and then post the pictures of her screenshotted news articles.

That is a ton of **hoops** to jump through, and I'm guessing there's a lot of people who are not nearly as tech **savvy** as Delaney is and wouldn't know how to do this.

You know, and as you might know, just like in the U.S., rural and **Indigenous** communities here in Canada often rely on Facebook for their news a lot more.

Canada was the **canary** in the digital coal mine here.

Yeah, I'll print some **transcripts** and mail them to my friends and family.
## phrase
And I **did reach out to** Meta about this story quite a few times, and Meta maintains that blocking news content is the only way it can **comply with** this new law.

The law in California is **on hold** until at least next year. It's **moved on to** the state senate there, but is **on pause** for now.
