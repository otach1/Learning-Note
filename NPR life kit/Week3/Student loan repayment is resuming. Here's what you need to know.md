[How to prepare for the return of student loan payments : Life Kit : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1185472693)
## vocabulary
So on September 1, the interest starts **accruing** again

Two, with all the **jargon** and the repayment plans and the options for loan forgiveness

we had this assembly where you show up and they do this **mind-numbing** PowerPoint 
presentation

I've been in the student loan industry doing **compliance** and **advocacy** work feels like since the Earth cooled.

and you have to be working for either a nonprofit - all 501(c)(3) nonprofits are **eligible**.

because maybe you go into the private **sector** for a little while

**Forbearances** and **deferments** are exactly the same, except where they're different.Â They're both tools that can be used to postpone the payments. And they have different eligibility requirements.

Forbearances tend to be a little more **loosey-goosey**.

I've already talked about and you let your loan go **delinquent** by 270 days or more, default is when all the really bad stuff happens.

They can and will **garnish** your wages at about 15%, and they can and will garnish other payments such as your Social Security or your tax refund and other things.

We call that the **avalanche** method. If you are someone that might need a little more frequent moments of **gratification**,

OK. It's time for a **recap**.
## phrase
Today we're **doing a deep dive on** student loan debt for two reasons.  

So it might take you longer than 10 years to **hit that mark**

I don't mean to **be flippant about** it

So default should be avoided **at all costs**.
