[The NFT craze may have finally run its course : The Indicator from Planet Money : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1197954434)
## vocabulary
I mean, it looks like an **ape** wearing a **striped** shirt. And is that a captain's hat?

And I'm Wailin Wong. Today on the show, we make sense of what happened during the NFT **frenzy** and try to **diagnose** whether there is any life left in them.

That **crypto** could be bitcoin, or it could be ethereum. Or it could be an NFT.

So I got **Mutant** Ape No. 8,272. He's an orange ape. His face is kind of melty, and he's wearing a **turtleneck** sweater made of **maggots**.

And not just alcohol - people were taking **ketamine** and mushrooms. It was a **star-studded** affair. Snoop Dogg performed.

I would meet - like, **pimply** teenagers would pull up their Ape and be like, my Ape's worth a million dollars. Your Ape's, like, the floor ape. It's a floor mutant. That's a big **insult**.

And there are so many **scammy** or kind of just pumped-up NFTs out there, and I definitely think that that is the majority.
## phrase
NFTs, these pieces of digital art that inspired a wave of cryptocurrency **mania** over the last couple of years - you had celebrities plugging them. Prices were **through the roof**.

So Zeke didn't take that much of a loss on his NFT, but others who **bought into** the **craze** did. Last year, a California law firm filed a **class-action suit** against the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, along with a host of celebrities like Justin Bieber and Paris Hilto.

Right. And there's other potential applications, like maybe being able to **pay out** royalties **on** artist work.
