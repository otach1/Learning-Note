[What to know about the new COVID boosters : Life Kit : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1196977654)

OK, Rob, we know coronaviruses **mutate** a lot. And since this booster was developed, new omicron subvariants have emerged.

So in the same way, health officials say getting an updated COVID shot can help bolster people's **waning** immunity as we **head into** **respiratory** virus season.

hat's the recommendation the CDC **endorsed** this week.

Now, COVID doesn't operate in a **vacuum**. There's also the flu virus and RSV **lurking** around out there, for example.

But as we're talking about all this, I'm also wondering, are there other **precautions** people should be taking right now, like, in addition to the booster?

If you can't afford to get sick, don't want to get sick because even, you know, even getting it for several days **stinks** - you know, it's no fun

And like I said before, you know, even if you're not worried because you're young and healthy, getting sick can, you know, still be a **bummer**.
## phrase
Now, we know a lot of people don't think about COVID all that much anymore - at least not in the **all-consuming way** we used to.

Yeah, that's the good news, and it came as a big relief. When it first emerged, BA.2.86 **set off** alarms because it had so many mutations.

But **a spate of** recent lab studies suggests it is no better at evading immunity than other circulating variants.

and maybe it actually could be a good idea to wait maybe four to six months to get **the best bang for the buck** from the new shots.
