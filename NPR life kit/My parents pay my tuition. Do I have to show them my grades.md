## vocabulory
My first semester at college was a little rocky as I realized that I have emotional **trauma** from my childhood, and I'm likely dealing with some **unaddressed** mental health issues.

I know that sounds really **stale** and **stiff**, but maybe there's some version of that conversation where you can actually define those expectations.

I believe hard conversations need to be **sandwiched**. Like, "I want to express my gratitude and love."

What can we agree on now, so that if something goes wrong and everyone's emotions are **heightened**, we don't make any **rash** decisions that ruin our relationship?
## phrase
It may be that the **stipulations** of them giving you money for college means that you have to **adhere to** their rules.

As awkward as it is, I think it's incredibly important to **put it down** on paper somewhere â€“ just to get everybody on the same page.
