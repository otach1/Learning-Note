[Ultra-processed foods are everywhere. Here's how to avoid them : Life Kit : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1182417634)
## vocabulary
Next time you're at the supermarket, pick up some packaged foods and look over the **ingredient** list.

That's usually a **telltale** sign that that's an ultra-processed food.

And also, you know, a lot of researchers I spoke with say, like, you don't want to **vilify** things like packaged breads.

I mean, for instance, if you like salty, **crunchy** snacks, which, you know, are really kind of what **beckon to** me around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, think about nuts, which are a good source of protein and fiber and healthy fats.

For instance, if you're buying canned beans and they have added sodium, really easy trick is to dump those beans into a **colander** and then let them drain for two minutes.

'm excited to look at it. But I also **shudder** to think.
## phrase
These are foods that are made with ingredients derived from foods, and then you reassemble them to create a product that's tasty, cheap, convenient and **shelf stable**, which means they last a long time.

And so they say, like, you don't want to **steer** people **away from** eating whole grain breads like that.

I mean, most researchers will tell you, yeah, cooking more **from scratch** is going to be a better option.

And basically the idea is 80% of the time, try to make thoughtful choices and pay attention to what you eat, but 20% of the time, just **go off the rails** because food is joy.
