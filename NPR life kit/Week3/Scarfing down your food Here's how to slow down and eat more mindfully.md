[Mindful eating: How to slow down, enjoy your meal and appreciate the food : Life Kit : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/09/1196977570/5-ways-to-eat-more-mindfully)
## vocabulory
You ever eat so fast that you get **hiccups** from just like inhaling the meal?

So how do we slow down and eat more **deliberately**?

Cheung suggests putting a small amount of snack food, like potato chips, in a separate bowl to help avoid mindless **munching**.
## phrase
[One study from 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36425257/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Mindfulness%20training%20in%20emotion,to%20conventional%20diet%2Dexercise%20interventions.)Â found that **incorporating** mindful eating **into** a weight-loss program helped reduce stress, anxiety and depression among adults with obesity.

Cheung says one way to slow down is to **engage your senses** and think through all the details about your meal.

Look at each bite before **popping it into your mouth**, acknowledge what you're eating and "chew, chew, chew," she adds.
