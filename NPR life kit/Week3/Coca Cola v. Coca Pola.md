[Coca-Cola's trademark dispute with indigenous coca company Coca Nasa : The Indicator from Planet Money : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1197954152)
## vocabulary
It was a **cease-and-desist** letter. It said that her company had **infringed** Coca-Cola's **trademark**, and they had 10 days to pull their drinks from the market or risk legal action.

Up until several years ago, it welcomed U.S. support in spring enormous amounts of pesticides from planes in order to destroy **illicit** coca plantations.

Yet even so, global government efforts to **eradicate** cocaine brought stigma to the coca leaf over the last half century or so.

But selling coca products outside of the indigenous territories put her in a bit of a legal gray area, with the Colombian government **flip-flopping** between tolerating and stamping out her products there.

I'm trying to buy from the same entity that produced that delicious, **carbonated** beverage in the past.

He wasn't involved directly in this case, but he says that Colombia has a **precedent** here.

This all **bolstered** Fabiola's case.

It's kind of a **stalemate**, which the Colombian trademark lawyer Manuel Travodiaga says might actually be the best solution for both Coke and Fabiola's company, Coca Nasa.

They **persecuted** us to get us to disappear from the market, but we have not disappeared.
## phrase
A corporate giant like Coca-Cola **gets into** a trademark dispute with a smaller company that's been using a particular word, or it even appropriates a name that's been used by another culture for a very long time.

Coca-Cola, with tens of billions of dollars' worth of annual sales, could afford some pretty good lawyers, which is what makes Fabiola's next decision all the more **jaw dropping**.

You might think you're right, and even the law could **back you up**, but you just don't risk your **publicity** that way.

As for Fabiola, she says she's concerned Coca-Cola could **come after** her again. She's trying to prepare herself if that happens. But still, she is **defiant**.
