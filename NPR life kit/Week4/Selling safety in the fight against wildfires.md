[Homeowners paying attention to increasing wildfire risk : The Indicator from Planet Money : NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1197954265)
## vocabulory
So there's lots of **Ponderosa pine**, some **spruce** and a lot of dead forest underneath and a tremendous amount of thick **duff**.

Right, so organic **debris**. If there's a fire, I imagine this is going to **smolder** a lot.

It's a **nascent** industry driven by technology, **panicked insurers** and homeowners starting to feel a whole new level of personal responsibility.

It's long-term fire **retardant**. It's the same thing they use during wildfires when it's dropped out of a plane.

You mentioned palm trees are kind of **flammable**.

Even though the research has been there for about 20, 30 years, we as a society are just starting to accept this notion that there is some degree of **accountability** on us as individual homeowners for living in these risk areas.

But that's a pretty recent paradigm - and I wouldn't even say it's a **paradigm** shift.

Think a fireproof roof that can stand up to **embers** that go flying through the air during a wildfire or covering **gutters** so embers don't land or adding mesh to air vents so embers don't float into your **attic**.Â And the big one is getting rid of plants and **mulch** within 5 feet of the house.
## phrase
So far, definitely. It's a Wild West of, like, smart **sprinklers** and air filters. But older techniques are also **popping up** now in residential areas.

It's **cascading off** a mountain. The street is **dotted with** palm trees.

Yeah, because home insurance companies are **freaking out**.
